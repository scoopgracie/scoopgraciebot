Although it is not required, you may copy (or symlink) the scoopgraciebot
subfolder to a more convenient location. Simply substitute that folder when this
file references the scoopgraciebot folder. However, note that the bot.py3 script
must be run from within the folder containing the robots and librobots.so files.
Also, if you put it in your home directory, do NOT call it scoopgraciebot!
The bot will not work if either a file or folder called scoopgraciebot exists in
the home directory.


---RUNNING THE BOT---
To run the bot, you first need to initialise the queue. To do this, open the
scoopgraciebot subfolder in a terminal window and type "./setup.py3
<start_url>", without the quotes. After doing this, type "./bot.py3" in the same
folder.

---STOPPING THE BOT---
To stop the bot, simply delete the scoopgraciebot file (NOT scoopgraciebot.json)
in the home directory of the user running the bot.

---RESUMING THE BOT---
To resume crawling, after stopping the bot, run ./bot.py3 (in the scoopgraciebot
folder) WITHOUT running ./setup.py3.
